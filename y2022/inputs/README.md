# Where can I get the puzzle inputs?

From Advent of Code website directly. Puzzle inputs are not licensed for
reproduction or distribution. See the [legal notice](https://adventofcode.com/about)
on adventofcode.com > About > Legal.
For example, you can get day 1 puzzle input (2022) from: <https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/1/input>.

You can add puzzle inputs in this directory with the format: day`day`, like: day01,
day25, etc. By doing so, you can `cargo run` puzzle binaries without specifing the
input paths. See [README](../../README.md) to learn how to run puzzles.
