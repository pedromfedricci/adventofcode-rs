# Where can I get the puzzle inputs?

See [README](../../README.md) to learn where to get puzzle texts and inputs from,
and how to run puzzle solutions.

You can add puzzle inputs into this directory with file names like this: day01,
day09, day25, etc. By doing so, you can `cargo run` puzzle binaries without
specifing input paths.
